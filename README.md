# Generate a random 5 word phrase from 3 files (dictionaries)

Inspired by the 'Password Strength' comic by [xkcd](http://xkcd.com/936/)

# What it does

Pass phrases are 5 words; adjective, noun, verb, adjective, noun. I find this pattern produces 
phrases which are easier to remember/visualise than 4 completely random words as recommended by the xkcd comic. 

## Usage

**From the command line**

    $ ./pass_phrase.py
    elegant pies gather unadvised coal

**In your own scripts**

There is no easy way to use it in your own scripts at the moment.
But if you really must use it _right this second_ in your own scripts then 
you can do:

    >>> from pass_phrase import generate_wordlist, passphrase
    >>> adjectives = generate_wordlist("adjectives.txt")
    >>> nouns = generate_wordlist("nouns.txt")
    >>> verbs = generate_wordlist("verbs.txt")
    >>> passphrase(adjectives, nouns, verbs, " ")
    'berserk history offend awful earthquake'

## Word files

The script expects 3 different word files, I've included examples of these in the repo:

+ adjectives.txt
+ nouns.txt
+ verbs.txt

It will check for the existence of these files in the current directory or in `~/.pass-phrase/`

If you want to use other files, or relocate them, use the command line options.

    $ ./pass_phrase.py --adjectives="/usr/share/dict/adjectives" --nouns="/usr/share/dict/nouns" --verbs="/usr/share/dict/verbs"

## Thanks

Thanks to Steven Tobin and his version of the [XKCD-password-generator](https://github.com/redacted/XKCD-password-generator), it inspired me to add some additional features to my own version. I've also used bits & pieces of the code from XKCD-password-generator here.
